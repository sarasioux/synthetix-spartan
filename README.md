# Synthetix Spartan NFT

## Overview

Entry for Gitcoin Bounty:
https://gitcoin.co/issue/snxgrants/open-defi-hackathon/7/100025688

This is a very simple game with play as follows:
* Each player is randomly generated a fighter with strength, stamina, and speed.
* When a new player joins, an existing player is randomly chosen for a chance to have a stat boosted.
* When the game ends, each player fights in a unique randomly generated battle against their own opponent.
* Rounds continue until only one player is left.
* If no players survive their match, the last player to join the game wins (hence the boost feature!)
* When a player wins, their fighter is minted into an NFT for them to keep.
* The NFT includes an SNX prize which can be claimed.
